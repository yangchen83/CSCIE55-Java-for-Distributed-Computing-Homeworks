Your submission should discuss the differences in performance observed between these two runs. Which way is faster? Why?

The test outside of the monitor is about 5 times (which corresponds to the server thread number) faster than the test inside of the monitor. After the command is retrieved and removed from the queue, the thread can release the monitor to other threads to get commands. Therefore the test outside of monitor is faster, because it is not holding the monitor while executing the command. On the contrary, the test inside of monitor holds the monitor while it is executing the command, which is unnecessary. This effect is like the HW4 transfer with locking the bank. There is synchronization, but no concurrency. Since there are 5 server side threads, therefore, the test outside of monitor is 5 times faster than that inside of the monitor.
